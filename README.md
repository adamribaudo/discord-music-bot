# Overview

This is a Discord bot that plays a folder of MP3's through a voice channel on Discord.

To run multiple instances of this app on a linux machine in the background:

`nohup python3 app.py [your_bot_profile_here]`

To find a background process PID:

`ps -ef`

To kill a process:

`kill -9 [id]`

# Commands
Only 2 commands are supported:
`!play` will tell the bot to join the voice channel and play mp3's
`!disconnect` will tell it to leave the voice channel. 

# Example

I built this so that I could host a Discord server that plays my music (I record under the moniker o8o8o8) non-stop. Feel free to join and listen! https://discord.gg/9Rg9qbRR
